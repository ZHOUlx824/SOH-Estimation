# Battery state of health estimation based on image recognition and voltage data reconstruction
This project proposes a novel approach for State of Health (SOH) estimation of lithium-ion batteries, combining voltage data reconstruction and image-based feature extraction. It uses LSGAN for missing data recovery, GAF for time-series to image transformation, Swin Transformer for visual feature extraction, and LSTM for time-dependent SOH prediction.
