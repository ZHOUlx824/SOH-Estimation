# Battery state of health estimation based on image recognition and voltage data reconstruction
This project proposes a novel approach for State of Health (SOH) estimation of lithium-ion batteries, combining voltage data reconstruction and image-based feature extraction. It uses LSGAN for missing data recovery, GAF for time-series to image transformation, Swin Transformer for visual feature extraction, and LSTM for time-dependent SOH prediction.

The file contains relevant model Python code examples. LSGAN.py, GAF.py, Swin Transformer+LSTM.py.

At the same time, we have provided some experimental data for your reference. The file contains aging data for two types of lithium-ion batteries: LiNCA and LiFePO4.
